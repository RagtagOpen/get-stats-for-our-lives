     "March for Our Lives New Jersey will take place on Saturday, March 24th, at MILITARY PARK in Newark, NJ, at 10 a.m., in conjunction with the national March for Our Lives event in Washington D.C. and with sister events across the state and country. March for Our Lives NJ is a student-centered, student-lead event. It is being planned by a committee students from diverse backgrounds who are coming together from schools across northern, central, and southern New Jersey. They are being supported by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America New Jersey and its local chapters, Women for Progress. OUR MISSION Written by student leader, Sarah Emily ΓÇô High School Senior ΓÇ£Not one more. We cannot allow one more child to be shot at school. We cannot allow one more teacher to make a choice to jump in front of a firing assault rifle to save the lives of students. We cannot allow one more family to wait for a call or text that never comes. Our schools are unsafe. Our children and teachers are dying. We must make it our top priority to save these lives.ΓÇ¥ -March for Our Lives, the National Organization March for Our Lives New Jersey is the sister march of a national movement led and inspired by young activists from Parkland, Florida, who survived the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14th. Young people are dying at an alarming rate from misuse and abuse of firearms. Seven of the 96 people killed in the United States by gun violence are children and teens, according to the Brady Campaign. In 2016, the CDC reported that gun violence killed more 15 to 19 year olds than cancer, diabetes and heart disease combined. Guns are also disproportionately used against young people of color, those of lower income brackets, and survivors of domestic violence. But these tragedies are largely preventable. Studies show that with universal background checks and other common sense gun laws we can reduce the carnage. We can stop the senseless violence. So what╩╝s stopping us? Lawmakers are putting a price on children╩╝s lives and ignoring evidence in favor of campaign contributions from the gun lobby. NOW WE SAY: NEVER AGAIN. School hallways should not be war zones, and students should not be going home in body bags. Together, as young people, we unite to demand justice, action, and government accountability. As the national March for Our Lives organization, says, ΓÇ£Change is coming. And it starts now, inspired by and led by the kids who are our hope for the future. Their young voices will be heard. Stand with us on March 24 ΓÇö refuse to allow one more needless death.ΓÇ¥\n"

Gun violence is not a new issue, but it has become increasingly pervasive as the people of this country continue to lose their lives, in part due to the inaction of our government. Help us in ensuring that those holding marches throughout the rest of this nation have the support that they need to push for common sense gun reform.\nWe will meet at Franklyn&#39;s Field on 1106 N James St at 1:00 PM, and will start walking at 1:30 PM, until we arrive at Rome City Hall on 198 N Washington St. This walk will likely take around half an hour, after which we will hold a rally on the sidewalks outside of the building.\nIf you are unable to participate in the actual march but would still like to attend the rally, we will likely arrive and gather at Rome City Hall around 2:00 PM.\n"

Mainly led by students, we created this out of inspiration from the brave teen survivors of Parkland Florida who founded the movement to speak up and create a nationwide demonstration and to demand that action be taken on the federal level to combat gun violence.\nΓÇïCameron Kasky, a student and survivor of the incident at Stoneman Douglas High School announced this on Sunday, February 18th, stating that the demonstration will take place on March 24th in every city across the United States.\nΓÇïWe, the students from the Cape Cod area have seen the courageous actions taken in Florida and likewise have decided that we need to help the cause. Because of this, we too will hold our march in Hyannis. We&#39;ve constructed a student board and will continue to plan this event through the collaboration of students from up and down the Cape.\nΓÇïStudents have a right to attend school without fear of attack. Teachers have a right to educate in an environment free of gun violence. Parents have a right to send their children to school without worry of them not returning at the end of the day. And we all as citizens have a right to live in a country where we are not faced with frequent mass shootings and a gun homicide rate 25 times that of other developed nations.\nΓÇïAs Cape Coders, New Englanders, and most importantly Americans, we feel vulnerable in the places we call home due to the inaction of elected officials. This event calls on them and their colleagues to act now to prevent needless deaths. Enough is enough.\nHyannis Village Green, 367 Main St, from 11am-3pm, on March 24th, the newly established Cape Cod Student Board will hold our satellite event for March For Our Lives Hyannis.\n"

     "The March for Our Lives movement has been a long time coming, and is the product of a nation that values objects more than human lives. The voices for the March for Our Lives are those of the generation that grew up with mass shootings.This is the sound of millions of voices across the country pleading for change- we say enough. End the violence. There has been more than enough blood, tears, and bullets- one school shooting is a school shooting too many.\nHowever, we cannot ignore the gun violence that people in the low income communities of Chicago witness in the streets, in their homes and in their classes every day. Most if not all of these tragedies are preventable. March for Our Lives Chicago holds the culprits of this plague of preventable gun violence accountable. We hold the NRA, the politicians that support them, and the arms manufacturers and dealers accountable. We also hold IllinoisΓÇÖ neighboring states accountable for having lax gun laws that lead to guns being brought into Illinois.\nThroughout this movement the voices of black and brown people have been widely ignored. With ChicagoΓÇÖs status as the seventh most racially diverse city in the nation, it is imperative we put a focus on intersectionality and raise these voices up. March for Our Lives Chicago includes the experiences of people of color, women, and LGBT individuals in our fight to make the streets safe for children again.\nIn 2017, 3456 Chicago citizens were victims to gun violence. We cannot have one more.\n"

We cannot allow one more family to wait for a call or text that never comes. Our schools are unsafe. Our children and teachers are dying. We must make it our top priority to save these lives.\nMarch For Our Lives is created by, inspired by, and led by students across the country who will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar. In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut short in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March For Our Lives believes the time is now.\n"

     "On March 24 in Japan time, in Nagoya, we are holding an indoor event to support the brave actions of the Florida&#39;s Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school students demanding sensible gun control measures in the US. Mrs. Mieko Hattori, resident in Nagoya, will join us and look back on her 25 year experiences as an advocate of gun control. In 1992, her son, Yoshihiro, 16, an exchange student in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was heading to a Halloween party and visited the wrong house and was gunned down there. Within a year of his death, Mieko and his husband Masaichi collected about 2 million signatures in Japan and in America calling for gun control measures in the US. They pressed their case with then U.S. President Bill Clinton, and they contributed to the enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which requires background checks on gun purchasers. Using money they were awarded in a civil suit against the man who shot their son, the Hattoris established a fund to bring U.S. high school students to study in Japan. So far, 25 American students have traveled to Japan. The program is a meaningful way to turn their sonΓÇÖs memory into cross-cultural understanding and a nonviolent exhange. In 2012, the Hattoris were given the title of honorary mayor of Baton Rouge. In this event, we are also making time for the paticipants to grab a michrophone and give their own solidality speeches in English and Japanese. We will record them and put them on YOUTUBE after editting.\n"

To take action for all those who were deprived of their lives in these tragedies that can be prevented. To stand up and make a change.\nThis is not a partisan issue. The deaths of students whose lives were cut short from an assault rifle will not be swept under the rug due to politics.

There is nothing more crucial than making sure that there is a passage of legislation to effectively address the gun violence issues that are plaguing the schools of America.\nOn March 24th, we will fill the streets of Springfield in conjunction with March For Our Lives to make sure no student or teacher will have to risk their lives waiting for change to happen. We will address that it is not okay for Smith and Wesson, who have their corporate headquarters in Springfield, to be selling assault rifles, such as the AR-15 that was used in the Stoneham Douglass shooting, to the public. Through this march we will demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues. We will demand that our voices be heard and that our safety and lives become a priority. As students we should not be worrying about what we would have to do during a active school shooting, we should be learning, playing, and growing.\nWe cannot live in fear any longer.\nChange needs to happen, and it starts now.

     "Dear Members of the Grand Valley Community,\nWhen seventeen lives were lost on February 14th at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, our nation, and particularly our youth and students, were once again exposed to the horrific manslaughter a gun allows some individuals to commit. With the human lives lost in shootings such as Columbine, Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, and Las Vegas still in our minds, one thing is clear: change is needed. The urgency for reform has only grown after several threats against schools in our community have surfaced. We refuse to remain complacent with thoughts and prayers, which is why we stand with our peers across the nation and demand action from our elected officials.\nIt is true that gun control is a difficult issue to confront. Few other issues are as controversial or difficult to target. However, there is no excuse to remain silent when guns are pointed at our communities, friends, and family. While not everyone will agree with our ideas and advocacy, we encourage everyone to listen and engage with our discussion over checks on guns.\nWe believe that gun control is an inevitable solution towards curbing gun violence and mass shootings. At the same time, we recognize that the Second Amendment must be upheld. However, the Second Amendment is not a guarantee to extremely lethal assault weapons and must not take precedence over the safety of our communities.\nWe also believe that a factor within these tragedies is the culture surrounding guns. However, we cannot expect this culture to change rapidly, if at all. Therefore, we cannot simply blame mass shootings on video games, teenaged ignorance, and mental health concerns and expect change.\nWe, like most people, do not blame guns for any of these tragedies. We blame the people with the gun in their hand. However, if that gun was not in their hand in the first place, we would not be mourning any of these mass shootings.\nWith these beliefs in mind, we see no reason but to expect moderate gun-legislation that will prevent shootings in a timely and effective manner by helping keep guns out of the wrong hands. We have carefully reviewed different gun control options, and have decided to ask our politicians at the state and national level to implement the following policies:\nRequire a background check every time a gun is exchanged.\nBegin research on firearm purchases, use, and deaths.\nPromote safe storage of guns.\nEnforce harsher punishments for violent gun crimes.\nRaise the minimum age to purchase assault weapons to twenty-one.\nBecause it is important that effective gun control policies be put into place, we take a firm stance against allowing teachers to carry guns on campus. First, this fails to curb gun violence outside of schools. Secondly, putting more guns into our schools only distracts from our education and creates more threats to our safety. In addition, guns on school campuses will not actually prevent shootings; an individual who wants to commit these horrific crimes will not care if they are injured or captured. Therefore, gun policies that stop shooters from having access to guns are far more sensible.\nIf you recognize that change is needed, join us and demand action from our lawmakers. Use your voice to turn the gunpoint away from schools and communities across the nation.\nSincerely,\nGrand Valley Students United\n"
